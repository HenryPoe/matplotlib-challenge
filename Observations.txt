Capomulin and Ramicane are both far better for tumor volume than either Infubinol or Ceftamin, or really any of the others for that matter.
And I suspect that since those two showed promise that is why they have more measurements than any of the others as well.

Since the breakdown of mice participants in the study by sex is essentially 50/50, you could
possibly assume that the treatments affect both male and female mice the same since their
weren't many outliers in the tumor volume of the treatments we looked at.

The treatment worked quite well for mouse s185, over the course of the study its tumor volume decreased by almost 50%.

There is a fairly high correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight, as would be expected.
